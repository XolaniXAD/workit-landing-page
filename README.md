- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [live site](https://xolanixad.github.io/workit-landing-page/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Node.js
- TailwindCSS

### What I learned

I learnt that using AI drastically speeds up the development process. TailwindCSS also makes styling easier as using utility classes is straightfoward. 

In terms of deployment on Github Pages, Copilot taught me to use the vite build script and that ensured that the styles were applied to the web page.

Additionally, I gained more experience with responsive design patterns and learned how to better structure my HTML for accessibility. Working with custom fonts and optimizing assets for web performance was also a valuable learning experience.

### Continued development

I need to refine my usage of the utility classes and also be able to practice better prompting.

### Useful resources

- [Github Copilot](https://github.com/copilot) - This helped me code faster

## Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge Github Copilot for using the classes that I needed but did not know.
